# AI Involvement Disclosure

This repository was developed as part of a Master's thesis project on "GenAI-driven Market Segmentation and Positioning for IoT Providers."

## Use of AI Tools

The following AI tools were used during development:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Used to assist with Python code generation, function structure, and iterative development of the multi-agent system.
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: Used for prompt optimization, agent design structure, architecture guidance, and evaluation planning.
- **Perplexity AI**: Used for scraping sample data on IoT vertical - geography pairs for the RAG.

## Human Oversight

All code was reviewed, tested, and finalized by the author (Juuso Kallio).  
AI-generated suggestions were accepted only when they aligned with project goals and quality expectations.

## Thesis Document

No generative AI was used in writing the thesis manuscript.

## Purpose of AI Use

AI tools were used to:
- Accelerate prototyping
- Enhance prompt engineering
- Improve architectural consistency
- Maintain alignment with research objectives
